# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Market Analyzer 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A website that tracks stock prices

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

A website that will use an API key to fetch data and stock prices given the user's input. It will show a ticker that shows the current price, and the day's highs and lows and display it on the screen. A buy and sell option may be added. Example: User input: "Nvidia" or "NVDA", and the output of the code would result in a big screen with a large number ticker that displays the current live price of Nvidia and the day's highs and lows. A feature to have the stock graphed may be added soon

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Stock price ticker works properly, displays a number tracking live market data, and displays current day's highs and lows of the price.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A graph is displayed that shows the stock's history depending on what timeframe the user selects

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A website built like tradingview

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to know how to get and utilize APIs, how to navigate visual studio code, learning how to import my code into a website/background that can show information, updating things in real-time, and a whole lot more.
